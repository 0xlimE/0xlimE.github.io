These were the steps that players had to navigate through to solve my challenge `Film til dig` that I created for "De Danske Cybermesterskaber" (DM i hacking 😉).

I was tasked with creating a hard web-hacking challenge for this yearly qualifier tournament that engages young people in technical cybersecurity challenges. 1093 persons signed up and 8 people in the Danish region managed to crack my challenge and capture both flags - Awesome!

Gamified cybersecurity challenges called CTF's (Capture the Flag) were my own gateway into ethical hacking back in 2019, and interest in these competitions in Denmark has grown tremendously over the past couple of years, thanks largely to De Danske Cybermesterskaber.

If you're interested in how to solve my challenge, I've written a comprehensive walkthrough on my newly revived blog: https://blog.r4.dk/posts/film-til-dig/
